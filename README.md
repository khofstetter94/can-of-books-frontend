## Collaboration

### Logistical

What hours will you be available to communicate?

- 9Am-6PM, Yari - AST, KC - PST

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- Slack

How often will you take breaks?

- Every hour or as needed

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

- Utilize TA help as much as possible

### Cooperative

Make a list of each person’s strengths.

- Yari: time management skills, React, organization
- KC: Javascript, organization & bug-catching

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

- Organization will keep our app in order and running smoothly. Open communication will keep us on track and lessen the time needed to solve problems. React and JS skills are important for this lab.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

- Yari: JavaScript, React CSS, terminology
- KC: React CSS, terminology, order of operations for API calls

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

- Daily Code Review, go to eachother first if we have problems - then decide as a team to call a TA

## Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

- We are open with conversation and communication, we agree to be honest with eachother if we think the other is falling behind. We also are open with asking each other for help.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

- Specifically asking for tasks to take over if the other person is dominating the tasks

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- We will approach each situation as either a student or teacher, and will accept the role as teacher if needed or as student if needed
